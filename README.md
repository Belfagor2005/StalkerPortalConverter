**Web Interface Access and Management Help**

This plugin includes a built-in web server that allows access to a full management interface.

### How It Works

* When the plugin starts, a **masked access code** is displayed (e.g., **"Access Code: 12••34"**).
* Open the displayed web address in your browser (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`).
* Enter the **full access code** shown in the plugin (e.g., `123456`).
* If the entered code is correct, you gain access to the management interface.

---

### Authentication System Features

* **Automatic code generation**:
  A random 6-digit code is generated on plugin start (if not already present).
  The code is stored in the plugin configuration.

---

### On-Screen Controls

In the main screen:

* You see **"Access Code: 12••34"** (yellow text).
* Green button: **"Show Code"**
* Red button: **"New Code"**
* Below the buttons, you see hints: **"0-SHOW"**, **"1-NEW"**

#### To reveal the full code:

* Press **"0"** on the remote control.
* The full code is shown (e.g., **"Access Code: 123456"**).
* After 10 seconds, it returns to the masked view (e.g., **"12••34"**).

#### To generate a new code:

* Press **"1"** on the remote control.
* A new 6-digit code is generated (e.g., `987654`).
* You see **"New Access Code: 987654"** for 15 seconds.
* Then it returns to masked view (e.g., **"98••54"**).

---

### Advanced Security

* Access is **temporarily blocked after 3 failed attempts**.
* **No hints** about the correct code are shown in error messages.
* Code check is **case-insensitive**.

---

### Playlist Management Interface

* View all saved portals and associated MAC addresses.
* Displayed in a structured, tabular format with logical grouping.

#### Available Actions:

* ✏️ **Edit** a portal (URL and MAC list)
* 🗑️ **Delete** an entire portal
* 🗑️ **Delete** a single MAC address

#### Confirmation & Feedback:

* Confirmation popup for all delete operations
* Visual feedback after each action

---

### Workflow

* Full management access from the main menu
* Inline editing with dedicated forms
* Automatic return to main view after operations

---

### Real-Time Updates

* Changes are saved directly to the playlist file
* Plugin reloads automatically
* Interface always reflects the current state

---

### How to Use

#### Access Advanced Management:

* From the homepage, click **"Full Management"**
* Or go directly to `/manage` in the browser

#### Edit an Entry:

* Click the ✏️ icon next to a portal
* Edit the URL and/or MAC list (comma-separated)
* Click **"Save Changes"**

#### Delete Items:

* 🗑️ Next to a portal: deletes the entire portal
* 🗑️ Next to a MAC: deletes only that MAC address

#### Add New Entries:

* Return to the homepage using the dedicated button
* Use the main form to add new entries

---

### Security Notes

* All operations require authentication
* Input validation before saving:

  * Correct URL format
  * MAC address validation
* Confirmation required for destructive actions
* Clear error messages for invalid operations

---

### 📂 Output

* Standard `.m3u` files for each portal
* Grouped and channelized for easy use
